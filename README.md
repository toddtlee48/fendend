# Weather-Journal App Project

# Project Instructions

## Overview
This is a project that incorporates webpack. It also entails using a different API and a SDK to make API calls. 

## Step 1
My suggestion is to have three terminal windows open. One for the development environment, one for the production environment and one for the server. 

## Step 2
Jest was used to test some of the code. To see the jest tests use command yarn jest this will take your through both files (app.test.js and server.test.js). 

## Step 3 
You should build the project next. You can do that by using the command Yarn build-prod
You would then have to turn the server on by using the command yarn start in your server window.
You can then use the development mode to see the page by using the command Yarn build-dev

## Step 4 
The page will popup in which you should be on port 8000. If you are not on port 8000 make sure you make that change.

## Step 5
Enter a city in the enter city text field and then provide a date from the date field selector and then press the generate button. 

## Step 6 
There is also a todo list form that you can use by entering text into the new text field and pressing enter. Your information should show up below under the items title as a list item. You can then check the developer tools under console for that item by typing in localstorage.
